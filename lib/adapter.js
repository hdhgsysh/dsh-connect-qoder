/**
 * The Qoder pi-ai adapter.
 *
 * One adapter instance serves both Qoder regions, because each region is just
 * another profile in the same map — the same way a single `PiAiAdapter` can
 * front several providers. Every model's `baseUrl` points at its region's
 * loopback shim, so routing a request to a model is enough to select the
 * region, the credential, and the signing path.
 *
 * The profile is assembled by hand rather than through `dsh-llm-pi-ai`'s
 * internal resolver: that helper is not part of the package's public export
 * surface, so every field it would have supplied has to be named here.
 *
 * @module dsh-connect-qoder/adapter

 * Narrow a catalog to the models the user enabled.
 *
 * An **empty list means "no filter"**, following the WorkBuddy convention: a
 * fresh install has saved nothing and must still see every model. Once the list
 * is non-empty it becomes an allow-list.
 *
 * This is shared because two independent readers must agree: the adapter builds
 * the model list DSH routes requests through, and the shim answers
 * `GET /v1/models`, which is what the picker's discovery actually reads. If they
 * diverge, unchecking a model removes it from one surface and leaves it in the
 * other — so the filtering lives in one place rather than being written twice.
 *
 * Re-exported from lib/catalog-entry.js: that module is dependency-free, which
 * is what lets lib/shim.js use it without dragging adapter.js's peer
 * dependencies along.

/**
 * Assemble one adapter covering every region.
 *
 * A single `PiAiAdapter` serves all regions because `registerAdapter` maps a
 * *set* of providers onto one adapter: registering each region in its own call
 * would leave only the last one owned, since a later call replaces the previous
 * registration rather than adding to it.
 *
 * @param options.regions - `[{ region, shim, catalog }]`, one entry per region.
 * @param options.preferMaximumContext - `() => boolean`, read per model build so
 *   the settings switch takes effect on the next `llm/adapters-updated`.
 * @param options.imageModeFor - `(modelId) => string`, the user's per-model image
 *   choice, read per model build for the same reason: turning a model's image
 *   input on or off must reach the picker without re-registering the adapter.
 * @param options.enabledIdsFor - `(regionId) => string[]`, the models the user
 *   wants offered in that region. An empty list means "no filter", not "none":
 *   a fresh install has saved nothing and must still show every model, which is
 *   the same convention the WorkBuddy bundle uses. Read per build so curating
 *   the roster reaches the picker on the next `llm/adapters-updated`.
 * @param options.resolveAttachments - `() => AttachmentStore | undefined`, the
 *   durable attachment service. **Omitting this breaks every image request.**
 *   pi-ai refuses any message carrying an image unless this resolves, so a route
 *   registered without it answers `UNSUPPORTED_CONTENT` ("pi-ai image input
 *   requires the durable attachment service") for the whole turn — which is what
 *   a model does the moment it reads back a screenshot it just produced.
 * @param options.resolveImageAccess - `(attachments, ref) => { readonlyPath } | undefined`,
 *   maps one durable image reference onto a path the request builder may read.
 *   Without it the store is reachable but no image can actually be located.
 * @returns `{ adapter, invalidate, providerIds }`.
