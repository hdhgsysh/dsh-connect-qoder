/**
 * DSH Connect Qoder — bring locally signed-in Qoder models into DeepSeek
 * Harness.
 *
 * The Qoder desktop apps (Qoder CN and the international Qoder) already hold a
 * valid sign-in on this machine. This bundle reads that sign-in, registers one
 * DSH provider per region, and routes each region's traffic through a private
 * loopback shim that speaks OpenAI to pi-ai and COSY-signed Qoder on the way
 * out.
 *
 * Both regions register unconditionally and independently: whichever apps are
 * signed in produce a visible model group, and a region with no credential
 * simply contributes no models. Nothing here starts an OAuth flow, and nothing
 * writes to the Qoder apps' own files.
 *
 * @module dsh-connect-qoder
