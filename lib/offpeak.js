/**
 * Off-peak pricing arithmetic.
 *
 * Split out of lib/adapter.js because none of it touches pi-ai — it is clock
 * arithmetic over a catalog entry — while adapter.js cannot be imported without
 * its peer dependencies installed. That split is what lets a test assert the
 * real rules instead of a stand-in: an earlier version of the row-projection
 * test passed a hand-written `RATES` object, which meant nothing checked that
 * the stand-in agreed with the shipped `rateNow`, and the "22:00 rate flip"
 * behaviour was asserted against a fiction.
 *
 * The two things here that are easy to get wrong, and are therefore the two the
 * tests lean on: a window whose end is not after its start crosses midnight, and
 * the discounted rate is `before × discount` while `price_factor` alone is the
 * *discounted* figure — reading it directly understates the daytime cost by
 * several times.

 * does NOT mean Shanghai — it means the *machine's* zone, so a host west of +08
 * would place the window eight hours off and invert the day. That went
 * unnoticed for as long as it did because a laptop in China is already on
 * `Asia/Shanghai`, which made the omission look correct; the `TZ=UTC` row of
 * CI is what caught it. `src/client/card.ts` carries the same fallback for the
 * card's copy of this arithmetic.
 *
 * `Intl` is used rather than a manual UTC offset because the promotion window is
 * declared in a named zone (`Asia/Shanghai`) and China has no DST — but a zone
 * that does would silently drift with a fixed offset.
