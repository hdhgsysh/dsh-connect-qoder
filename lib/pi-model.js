/**
 * The pi-ai model descriptor.
 *
 * Extracted from lib/adapter.js so it can be tested. `toPiModel` is a pure
 * function of a catalog entry and a few flags — it builds a plain object and
 * touches no pi-ai API — but it lived inside a module whose top-level imports
 * pull in `@earendil-works/pi-ai` and `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm-pi-ai`, so no test
 * could reach it.
 *
 * That mattered, because this function carries two decisions whose failure mode
 * is invisible until every single request breaks:
 *
 * 1. `compat.supportsDeveloperRole: false`. pi-ai picks the system-prompt role
 *    as `reasoning && compat.supportsDeveloperRole ? 'developer' : 'system'`,
 *    and auto-detects the flag when it is unset — returning true for anything
 *    that does not look like a known non-standard provider. This route's baseUrl
 *    is the loopback shim, so nothing matches and the value resolves to true.
 *    Every Qoder model declares `reasoning: true`, so pi-ai then emits
 *    `role: "developer"`, which Qoder does not have. The result is a permanent
 *    `403 {"code":"10605"}` on every attempt, no matter how long DSH retries,
 *    with an error message about being "in the queue" that is pure fiction.
 * 2. `maxTokens` is deliberately ABSENT. A declared value becomes the model's
 *    configured output ceiling and pi-ai sends it as `max_tokens`; reasoning
 *    shares that budget with the answer, so a declared ceiling truncates long
 *    replies mid-sentence and the harness reports `finish: max-tokens`.
 *
 * Neither is a cosmetic field, and neither was asserted anywhere.
 *

 * on the model **id** (the selector's choice, the session events, the wire
 * request), so decorating the name is display-only and cannot affect routing.
 *
 * A zero multiplier means the model is free, which is worth saying outright;
 * anything else is shown to two decimals so the ordering is comparable. A
 * catalog entry with no multiplier at all keeps its bare name.
