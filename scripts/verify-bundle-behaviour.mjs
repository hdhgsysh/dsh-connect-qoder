/**
 * Prove a rebuilt `lib/client.js` still *behaves* like the one it replaced.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/verify-bundle-behaviour.mjs [--baseline HEAD]
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Byte-for-byte reproduction of the shipped bundle turned out to be
 * unreachable: the original was built by a toolchain this repository never
 * had, so a rebuild differs in formatting, in bundler scaffolding, and in
 * whether comments survive (docs/issues/17). "Differs in bytes" is therefore
 * the expected outcome, and it says nothing about whether the card still
 * works. This asks the question that matters instead: run both bundles, call
 * every pure function with the same arguments, and compare what comes back.
 *
 * The baseline defaults to `git show HEAD:lib/client.js`, so after a rebuild
 * it answers "did this change behaviour since the last commit", and after a
 * commit it becomes a regression check against the previous release.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT SEE
 *
 * Rendering. The bundle is executed with stub `react` and `react/jsx-runtime`,
 * which is enough to define the components but not to mount them — JSX comes
 * back as `null`. Everything that is a pure function of its arguments is
 * covered; anything that needs a DOM needs a browser (docs/KNOWN_GAPS.md).

 * A fixed instant, used while both bundles are fingerprinted.

 * WHY: the probe pool deliberately contains `undefined`, and the card's

 * wall clock. The two bundles are loaded milliseconds apart, so those calls
 * legitimately returned different seconds and the script reported "N differing
 * call(s)" for an artefact that had not changed — a flake that made this gate
 * untrustworthy exactly when it mattered. It was registered in
 * docs/KNOWN_GAPS.md（仍未建立的东西）as "freeze the probe clock"; this is that
 * fix.
 *
 * Patching `Date` alone was NOT enough, and the reason is worth recording:
 * `localSecondsOf` hands its argument straight to
 * `Intl.DateTimeFormat.format(date)`, and per ECMA-402 a non-Date argument is
 * converted to a Date via `ToNumber` — for `undefined` that is `NaN`, and the
 * result is `%CurrentDateTime%`: the *engine's* clock, read through an internal
 * slot that no `Date` override can reach. So the clock is frozen at the source
 * by replacing `Intl.DateTimeFormat` as well, which is the only handle a
 * bundled card actually reads time through.
 *
 * Applied only around the fingerprinting: `load()` itself runs real code that
 * must see the real clock.
