/**
 * Prove `lib/index.js` is a faithful, current build of `src/host/`.
 *
 * Run: npm run verify:host  (also part of `npm run verify`)
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Before the TypeScript migration the host half WAS `lib/*.js`: the files the
 * suite imported were the files that shipped, so a stale artifact was
 * impossible. Now `src/host/*.ts` is the source of truth and `lib/index.js` is
 * a build artifact, which introduces a failure mode the old layout could not
 * have — edit the source, forget to rebuild, and the deployed plugin runs last
 * week's code with a version number that says otherwise. `lib/` is git-ignored,
 * so nothing else in the repository would notice.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHECKS
 *
 * 1. PRESENT — `lib/index.js` exists and is non-empty. A checkout that was
 *    never built fails here rather than shipping an empty entry point.
 * 2. FRESH — rebuilding from `src/host/` reproduces the artifact byte-for-byte.
 *    The build is deterministic (single entry, `splitting: false`, no minify,
 *    no sourcemap), so any difference means the committed-into-the-working-tree
 *    artifact is stale.
 * 3. ENTRY — the bundle keeps the plugin's public surface: it still exports
 *    `Config` and `apply`, and it still declares the three peer packages the
 *    runtime resolves rather than bundling them. This is what catches a
 *    `deps.neverBundle` regression that would otherwise inline a Host package
 *    into the plugin and break at activation.
 *
 * A machine without dev dependencies (no `tsdown`) prints a loud SKIP and exits
 * 0: the suite is deliberately installable-free, and a missing devDependency is
 * not a regression. CI's offline job always takes that path.
