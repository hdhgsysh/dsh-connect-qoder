 * refresh would look broken. `end` not after `start` means the window
 * crosses midnight (`22:00`-`08:00` is the case Qoder uses), so the test
 * is a disjunction.
 *
 * The `active` gate is load-bearing and must match the host's own rule
 * (`isOffPeakActive` in lib/offpeak.js, reached here through
 * `projectModelRow`). Qoder keeps the window fields populated on a
 * promotion it has switched off, and `upstream.normalizePromotion` carries
 * `active` and `windowStart`/`windowEnd` independently, so a window alone
 * is NOT evidence that the discount is live. Without this check a model
 * whose promotion is off was rendered at the discounted rate during its
 * own hours — showing the user a price they are not charged — and the two
 * surfaces (card and picker) disagreed, because the host was correctly
 * showing the `before` rate for that same model.
 *
 * The bug needs a mixed catalog to appear: the ticking clock is installed
 * when ANY model has `active === true` (see the `hasActiveWindow` gate),
 * and from then on every row re-resolves through this function.
 *
 * SYNC CONSTRAINT: this mirrors lib/offpeak.js. The card runs in the browser
 * and cannot be imported into a Node test, so the rule is pinned twice:

/**
 * The account section: a version strip over the SELECTED region's
 * sign-in — who drives it, in which state it is, and what to do when
 * it is not `ok`. The strip is the card's convergence point: each
 * region is one pill (status dot + name + provider switch), and
 * selecting a pill scopes this detail, the usage panel and the model
 * list to that region, so the region name appears exactly once on the
 * card. `activeRegion` / `onRegionChange` are the card-level pair that
 * drives all three surfaces.
 *
 * The states come from the host's account route and are computed from
 * LOCAL evidence only, so reading the panel costs no network. The
 * deliberate actions are:
 *
 * - **Re-read sign-in** POSTs to the host's reload route, which
 *   invalidates the credential caches, re-reads the app stores, and
 *   starts any region that has come back online — a re-sign-in is
 *   picked up without restarting DSH. `onReconciled` lets the card
 *   re-pull its models and usage once the read has landed.
 * - **Confirm online** is the single optional network call
 *   (`fetchUserInfo`): it answers "is this sign-in still valid at the
 *   upstream?", a question a disk read cannot answer on its own.
 * - The pill's **provider switch** writes `enabledRegions` (opt-out:
 *   absent = offered) through the settings pipeline; a switched-off
 *   region contributes zero models, and the picker + card list hide
 *   it via the same host predicate.

/**
 * Whether the card starts expanded, resolved from the host's `view`.

 * The host renders a slot card with one of three shapes:
 *
 * - `view: "page"` — the card is the page itself (the bundle / row
 *   detail pages, and the WorkBuddy-style detail surface). Collapsing a
 *   page would leave the user staring at an empty screen, so the card
 *   opens by default. This is the "auto-expand" behaviour borrowed from
 *   the WorkBuddy bundle.
 * - `view: "summary"` — the card sits in a list of cards, where an
 *   expanded card would push every sibling off-screen; start collapsed
 *   and let the header click do the work.
 * - no `view` (legacy slots that predate the prop) — the previous
 *   default was collapsed, and keeping it means an old host surface
 *   does not suddenly change shape on upgrade.
 *
 * Collapsing is never destructive: the card's body is `hidden`, not
 * unmounted, so staged edits and a ticking off-peak countdown survive a
 * collapse/expand cycle.
 *
 * @param view - the `view` prop the host slot passed, if any.
 * @returns true when the card should start expanded.
