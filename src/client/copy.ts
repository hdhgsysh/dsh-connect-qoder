/**
 * Card copy — the public entry point.
 *
 * The actual translations live in three section files:
 * - `copy-row.ts` — model row labels, search, filter, off-peak
 * - `copy-usage.ts` — usage panel and daily check-in
 * - `copy-account.ts` — account panel and region tabs
 *
 * This file merges them into the single `{ zh, en }` shape the card expects,
 * so `index.ts` and `card.ts` import from one place.
