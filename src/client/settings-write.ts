/**
 * Verified settings writes, adapted from the WorkBuddy bundle's
 * `writeField` contract (src/client/account-selection) to this card's
 * three top-level fields.
 *
 * `settingsScope.set()` resolving is NOT proof that anything was stored.
 * The Host's settings document is replaced by writing a temp file and
 * renaming it over the target; on Windows an antivirus scanner or a sync
 * client can hold the file briefly, and once the atomic-write retries
 * exhaust the settings scope reloads Host state and merely RETURNS — the
 * card's `await` succeeds while the document is unchanged. Reading the
 * field back is the only reliable check, and the plugin's own Host
 * endpoint is the only writer that actually persists in that failure
 * mode (it runs the mutate inside the Host process).
 *
 * Field shapes, matching the Host `__save` whitelist:
 * - `enabledModelIds` is per-region, so the write posts only the
 *   regions the card edits and the Host merges them into the
 *   authoritative value — saving one region can never delete the
 *   other's allow-list.
 * - `imageOverrides` / `useMaximumContextWindow` are posted whole; the
 *   card always knows their complete value.
 */
/**
 * A settings write that did not take effect.
 *
 * Distinct from a rejected `set()`: thrown when the write reported
 * success (or the read-back disagreed) — which is the whole point of
 * this module. The card shows it, so the user knows the value is not
 * saved instead of trusting a "已保存" banner over stale settings.
 */
/**
 * The settings surface the card writes through, as this module reads it.
 *
 * One shape covers BOTH Host lines, which is why it is declared here rather
 * than imported: `configForms.get(ns)` (0.1.7) and `settingsScope.bind({ns})`
 * (0.1.6) are deliberately mirrored onto each other by `client/index.ts`, so
 * the card body — and this writer — never branches on which one is present.
 * `client/index.ts` keeps its own two probes; what that file hands the card is
 * a value satisfying this interface.
 *
 * Every member is read defensively by the callers: `set` may reject, and
 * `getSnapshot().value` is `undefined` for a namespace the Host has not
 * materialized yet (that is the `fieldSnapshot` catch, not a programming error).
