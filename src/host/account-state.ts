/**
 * What sign-in state one Qoder region is in, from local evidence only.
 *
 * The states, in the order a machine can be:
 *
 * - **`ok`** — a credential is readable and not expired: either an app
 *   sign-in whose store says so, or an env PAT (the PAT never expires on its
 *   own, so presence is the whole test).
 * - **`expired`** — an app sign-in is readable but its store says the access
 *   token has lapsed. The fix is to sign in again in the app; nothing this
 *   module does can cure it.
 * - **`needs-app`** — an app directory for the region exists but yields no
 *   credential: the OSCrypt key could not be unwrapped, or the app is
 *   installed without a sign-in yet. `detail` carries the recorded unwrap
 *   reason when there is one, so the card can say *why* rather than showing a
 *   blank.
 * - **`signed-out`** — no app directory and no PAT: there is simply nothing
 *   to use on this machine.
 *
 * Two rules keep the module honest:
 *
 * - **No network.** Every state is decidable from local files (and the
 *   recorded unwrap outcome). The optional online confirmation the card
 *   offers is a separate route that calls `fetchUserInfo`; it refines an
 *   `ok`/`expired` state but is not what produces these states.
 * - **No credential.** The record hands back `name` / `email` / `expiresAt`
 *   — identity, for display — and never the token or its refresh half. The
 *   card is a browser surface; a token reaching it is a leak, and this
 *   module's output is the only account payload the card ever receives.
 *
 * Split out like `lib/credential-cache.js`: the decision has no Cordis
 * context of its own, so it can be asserted against the real code with the
 * store readers injected.

 *   route runs on every panel render, and an unwrap is a synchronous PowerShell
 *   child with a 30 s timeout, so a machine that cannot unwrap would block the
 *   host's event loop once per render instead of showing the `needs-app` state
 *   the panel exists to explain (issue 07). The consequence is deliberate and
 *   visible: until something else unwraps the key — the startup refresh, the
 *   periodic catalog refresh, or the user pressing "重读登录" — the panel reads
 *   `needs-app`. That is the same state it would have shown anyway, reached
 *   without the freeze.
 * @param options.force - when true, bypass the unwrap failure window and read
 *   the store for real. This is the counterpart to `cachedOnly`, for the one
 *   request that IS a user-initiated re-read; without it, pressing "重读登录"
 *   inside the window would silently do nothing.
 * @returns a state record shaped as
 *   `{ region, displayName, manageUrl, downloadUrl, state, source, appName, identity, detail }`,
