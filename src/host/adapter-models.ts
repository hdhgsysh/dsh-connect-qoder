/**
 * The model list one region offers DSH — the decisions inside the adapter,
 * without the adapter.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A MODULE
 *
 * `createQoderAdapter` (lib/adapter.js) cannot be imported by a test: it pulls
 * in `@earendil-works/pi-ai` and `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm-pi-ai`, which this
 * repository does not install. So the whole file was outside the coverage
 * denominator (docs/issues/11), and the model list — which is where every user-
 * visible curation decision happens — was among the untested parts: the per-
 * region switch, the allow-list filter, the maximum-context preference and the
 * per-model image mode.
 *
 * All four are pure functions of their arguments, and all four have a failure
 * mode that is silent: a switch that stops switching hides a provider with no
 * error, a filter that stops filtering offers models the user unticked, a
 * context preference that is ignored is invisible until someone compares the
 * card with the picker.
 *

   * the runtime itself carries the `CatalogStore` as a property and the card
