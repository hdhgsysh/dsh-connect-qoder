/**
 * The daily check-in: deciding whether the upstream has anything to claim,
 * and reading back what a claim returned.
 *
 * Qoder hands each account a fresh campaign every day at 10:00 (UTC+8) — a
 * new `campaignId` each round, always carrying a 100-Credit benefit — and the
 * account claims it once per round. Everything this module needs is already
 * answered by the route the usage panel reads (`GET /sash/api/v1/me/campaigns`),
 * so no extra shape of request is invented here: the same payload that feeds
 * the promotional copy also carries `actionType` and `claimStatus`.
 *
 * Two filters matter, and field evidence (2026-09-27, both regions) is why:
 *
 * - **`actionType`** must be `CLAIM_BENEFIT`. The very same account carries a
 *   second campaign of type `VIEW_DETAILS` (a subscription promotion with no
 *   benefit at all) that nevertheless reports `claimStatus: "CLAIMED"`. Judging
 *   by status alone would send a claim POST at a campaign that has nothing to
 *   hand out.
 * - **`claimStatus`** is what distinguishes a claimable round from a claimed
 *   one. The payload's own top-level `claimable` flag answers `false` for both
 *   "already claimed today" and "nothing is running", and `claimable` on the
 *   campaign itself does not exist as a field at all, so neither can be trusted
 *   as the gate.
 *
 * An unknown `claimStatus` is treated as claimable rather than as claimed.
 * The upstream makes claiming idempotent (a repeat answers `replayed: true`
 * and grants nothing), so the cost of being optimistic is one wasted request,
 * while the cost of being pessimistic is hiding the feature permanently the
 * day Qoder renames its statuses.
 *
 * A list that carries no `CLAIM_BENEFIT` round at all reads as
 * `active: false` by design — that is not a missing feature the selector
 * failed to find. The international campaigns endpoint answers requests
 * without the desktop app's umid machine identity with the evergreen
 * `VIEW_DETAILS` banner only (verified 2026-09-27 against the live endpoint);
 * the daily round lists itself to machine-identified reads, which is what
 * `readCampaigns` now sends (`lib/upstream.js`, `openApiHeaders`). A reduced
 * list is therefore the upstream's answer to a request it could not bind to
 * a machine, not a selector bug; this module cannot distinguish the two, and
 * must not pretend to.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the network, and nothing here carries a campaign id to
 * the caller that would let it claim a stale round: the claim route re-reads
 * the campaigns for itself, which is the order the upstream requires.
