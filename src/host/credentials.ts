/**
 * Qoder credential acquisition.
 *
 * The Qoder desktop apps (Qoder CN, Qoder, QoderWork CN) keep their sign-in in
 * a VS Code style SQLite store (`state.vscdb`) whose secret rows are Chromium
 * OSCrypt blobs: `"v10" || nonce(12) || ciphertext || tag(16)`, encrypted with
 * an AES-256-GCM key that is itself wrapped by the OS keystore and kept in the
 * app's `Local State` under `os_crypt.encrypted_key`.
 *
 * On Windows that wrapper is DPAPI scoped to the current user, which is why any
 * process running as the same user can unwrap it — that is the property this
 * module relies on. The unwrap is delegated to PowerShell because Node has no
 * built-in DPAPI binding, and the result is exchanged through a temp file
 * rather than a pipe so the call also works under a sandbox that forbids
 * piped stdio.
 *
 * That temp file is the weakest link of the design, so it is hardened: the
 * key is written through an exclusive handle whose ACL is restricted to the
 * current user, the interpreter is invoked by absolute system path with a
 * minimal whitelisted environment (a user-supplied `QODER_PAT` never reaches
 * the child), the file is zeroed before unlink on the normal path, and
 * {@link sweepStaleOscryptDirs} reclaims the orphans a crashed or killed run
 * leaves behind at the next startup. Each temp dir carries an identity marker
 * file so the sweep never acts on a name-prefix collision with someone else's
 * directory (issue 01).
 *
 * Nothing here writes to the Qoder apps' files: the store is opened read-only.

/**
 * Per-app OSCrypt key cache; the DPAPI unwrap is not free, so do it once.
 *
 * Only a **successful** unwrap is remembered. A failure is transient far more
 * often than it is permanent — a cold PowerShell that blows the 30 s timeout, an
 * antivirus that swallows the `Add-Type` compile, a `%TEMP%` on a network share
 * — and caching the `undefined` would pin that one failure for the life of the
 * process: `has()` would hit, the unwrap would never be attempted again, and the
 * user would see "not signed in" (or a provider that silently never appears) with
 * nothing to explain it. A missed unwrap costs one subprocess, so retrying is
 * the cheap side of the trade.
 *
 * WHAT THE KEY IS AND WHAT INVALIDATES IT
 *
 * The entry is keyed by app directory and remembers the identity of the
 * `Local State` it was unwrapped from, so a key is only ever reused while that
 * file is unchanged. This is the fix for a permanent, self-inflicted `needs-app`
 * (issue 08): the cache was keyed by directory alone, so a Qoder reinstall or a
 * profile reset — which rewrites `Local State` with a fresh
 * `os_crypt.encrypted_key` — left the process decrypting with the OLD key. Every
 * subsequent read failed, no code path could ever retry, and the region stayed
 * "unreadable" until DSH was restarted. Binding the cache to the file's identity
 * turns that into an ordinary cache miss.
 *
 * The identity is `mtimeMs` + `size` rather than a hash of the contents, which
 * is a deliberate trade: hashing means reading the whole file (tens of KB) on
 * every credential resolution, and `Local State` is written atomically by a
 * replace, so any content change lands with a new mtime. A same-millisecond
 * rewrite of identical size is the one case this cannot see, and it is also the
 * one case where the old key is still correct.

 * key as plain base64, readable by anyone who can read the temp directory.
 * Call this at startup to reclaim it.
 *
 * Only directories whose last write is at least `maxAgeMs` old are touched: a
 * fresh one may belong to another DSH instance unwrapping right now, and its
 * key file is held open (exclusive) for the duration of the call. The default
 * 5 minutes is safe because a live unwrap finishes within the 30 second call

 * proves its identity (issue 01). A prefix collision — another tool's residue,

 * module's startup code zeroing files that are not ours. Three checks, all on
 * `lstat`/`readdir`, none following links into the directory's contents:
 *
 *   1. the entry is a real directory, not a symlink or junction (Node reports
 *      Windows reparse points — junctions included — as symbolic links from
 *      `lstat`, so one check covers both platforms);
 *   2. it carries the {@link OSCRYPT_MARKER} file our unwrap writes, and
 *      contains nothing except `key.b64` beside it;
 *   3. `key.b64` decodes as base64 to exactly 32 bytes — the size of a real
 *      OSCrypt master key (a wrong-size file is reported and left alone: it is
 *      not ours to delete, whatever its name says).
 *
 * A directory that fails check 1 is reported (planted links around a
 * credential-sweep name are worth knowing about); one that fails 2 or 3 is
 * passed over silently as a foreign object — the third-party tool that owns
 * it must get no "could not reclaim" warning from a plugin that never had a
