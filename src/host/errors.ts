/**
 * Read a Qoder error frame and decide what it actually is.
 *
 * Codes that arrive here have very different meanings, and conflating them sent
 * the user looking at their account for what is really a queue:
 *
 * - **105 / TOKEN_EXPIRE** — the sign-in is gone. Nothing will succeed until
 *   the user signs in to the Qoder app again.
 * - **10605** — the request was queued or rate-limited. The body carries
 *   `retryAfterSeconds` and `serviceAvailable`, so it is transient and must be
 *   treated as retryable rather than as a rejection.
 * - **110** — the account's DAILY billing count is spent. Transient in the sense
 *   that it clears, but not in the sense that waiting helps within a session: it
 *   resets at the day boundary, and the gateway still sends a Retry-After
 *   measured in HOURS with it (7350 s in the report this rule is written from).
 *   Retrying it produced a user reading "重试延迟：7350 毫秒" for something a
 *   queue would have cleared in two seconds. So it is its own kind, never a
 *   queue — see the ordering note on the check itself.
 * - **protocol shape changes** — not a frame at all but an envelope this code
 *   no longer recognises; they arrive as a 200 and are raised separately, as
 *   ProtocolShapeChangedError.
 *
 * Exact code matches decide first, so a sign-in failure is never shadowed by a
 * stray field name; the marker regex only fires as a fallback, and only when
 * at least two queue markers co-occur, so an auth error that happens to carry
 * a `retryAfterSeconds` field is not misread as a queue.

 * alone: waiting cannot fix a shape, and burning the two-minute budget on it
 * is what produced "the plugin needs an update" arriving as a two-minute hang.
 *
 * The flag is on the error rather than in its name so the classifier can read
 * it from a caught value that lost its prototype (a cross-realm throw, a
