/**
 * The pi-ai model descriptor.
 *
 * Extracted from lib/adapter.js so it can be tested. `toPiModel` is a pure
 * function of a catalog entry and a few flags — it builds a plain object and
 * touches no pi-ai API — but it lived inside a module whose top-level imports
 * pull in `@earendil-works/pi-ai` and `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm-pi-ai`, so no test
 * could reach it.
 *
 * That mattered, because this function carries two decisions whose failure mode
 * is invisible until every single request breaks:
 *
 * 1. `compat.supportsDeveloperRole: false`. pi-ai picks the system-prompt role
 *    as `reasoning && compat.supportsDeveloperRole ? 'developer' : 'system'`,
 *    and auto-detects the flag when it is unset — returning true for anything
 *    that does not look like a known non-standard provider. This route's baseUrl
 *    is the loopback shim, so nothing matches and the value resolves to true.
 *    Every Qoder model declares `reasoning: true`, so pi-ai then emits
 *    `role: "developer"`, which Qoder does not have. The result is a permanent
 *    `403 {"code":"10605"}` on every attempt, no matter how long DSH retries,
 *    with an error message about being "in the queue" that is pure fiction.
 * 2. `maxTokens` is deliberately ABSENT. A declared value becomes the model's
 *    configured output ceiling and pi-ai sends it as `max_tokens`; reasoning
 *    shares that budget with the answer, so a declared ceiling truncates long
 *    replies mid-sentence and the harness reports `finish: max-tokens`.
 *
 * Neither is a cosmetic field, and neither was asserted anywhere.
 *

 * The same decision the wire makes, expressed for the picker: a model that

 * unsupported for it rather than offered and then rejected upstream.
 *
 * `off` is a wire spelling, not a switch, and this is where the plugin's
 * default-thinking behaviour lives. pi-ai's openai-completions builder has
 * two different dispatches that both read this one key:
 *
 * - **default** (no effort selected in the DSH picker): it sends
 *   `reasoning_effort` ONLY when `off` holds a string; an absent key means
 *   "supported, send nothing" — so an absent `off` is what makes a bare
 *   model selection reach the shim without an effort, and the shim then
 *   defaults to the model's own thinking nature (the WorkBuddy/Trae shape:
 *   their maps never carry an `off` string, which is why their "Default"
 *   thinks while this plugin's used not to — it spelled `off` out, so the
 *   default path sent an explicit `reasoning_effort: 'off'` and the shim
 *   obeyed it).
 * - **an explicit `off` selection**: it falls back to the level's own name
 *   (`?? options.reasoningEffort`), so "off" is still offered in the picker
 *   and still disables thinking for a model that can disable it. An absent
 *   key therefore keeps off functional while changing what "no choice"
 *   means — the two states that used to be indistinguishable.
 *
 * A non-reasoning model gets no map at all, rather than a map of nulls.
