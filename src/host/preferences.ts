 *
 * Two of the three settings are read on every model build and on every listing,
 * so their resolution sits on the hot path of a card render. The interesting
 * part is the 0.1.7 live-reference shape: a volatile field holds `{ get() }`

 * `useMaximumContextWindow` is the one plain boolean. Every field is optional
 * because absence is meaningful throughout this module — an absent allow-list
 * means "no filter" and an absent region switch means "offered", which is the
 * opposite of a default-filled document.
 *
 * The `VolatileRef<>` wrappers are not decoration: on the 0.1.7 line each of

 * A non-empty list that matches no real model id collapses to "show nothing" in
 * `filterByEnabled` (the allow-list branch keeps the ids, matches none, returns
 * `[]`), so a marker that no model id can ever equal expresses "hide all"
 * without touching that convention.
 *

 * `null` reads better in a hand-edited settings file, but every existing user
 * has `["__hide-all__"]` in their document, and a format change would silently
 * turn their "hide all" into "show all". So the marker stays and the invariant
