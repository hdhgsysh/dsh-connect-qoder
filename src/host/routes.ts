/**
 * The gates every card route passes through, and the body reader they share.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A MODULE
 *
 * These four functions used to live inside `lib/index.js`, which cannot be
 * imported by a test — it pulls in the Cordis peer dependencies, and this
 * repository installs none of them. That made the whole request-authentication
 * surface untestable: the method check, the origin check, the body cap, and the
 * 405/403 responses could all be wrong with the suite fully green
 * (docs/KNOWN_GAPS.md item 1（`adapter.ts` 的 Cordis 接线与 profile 构造）and item 2（`RegionRuntime` 本身与 `activate` 的 Cordis 接线）).
 *
 * The alternative considered and rejected first was
 * `--experimental-test-module-mocks`. It was implemented and measured, and it
 * does not work here: `mock.module()` requires the specifier to be RESOLVABLE
 * before it can stub it, and the whole point is that these packages are not
 * installed. A resolver hook cannot help either — `lib/index.js` imports
 * `adapter.js` statically at module scope, which is resolved before the hook
 * chain sees it. KNOWN_GAPS claimed this route was "verified feasible"; on this
 * machine it is not, and that claim is corrected there.
 *
 * So the gates are here, dependency-free and importable, and `lib/index.js`
 * imports them. The handlers themselves stay where they are: what is worth
 * asserting is that every route passes the same gates with the same
 * parameters, and that is now a matter of reading five call sites rather than
 * re-deriving a whole module.

/**
 * Read a JSON body and answer a bad one properly, instead of throwing.

 * catch-all answers a **bodyless 400** — which the card can only render as
 * "HTTP 400". That is undiagnosable from the browser: the same status would mean
 * a malformed request, a request that was too large, or a bug in the route, and
 * the user is told none of which.
 *
 * So the failure is turned into a response here: a 400 carrying `errorName` and
 * the parse message, matching what the save route already does with its own
 * failures (`lib/settings-save.js` reports `read-back-mismatch` the same way).
 * The route then simply returns, and every caller gets the same shape.
 *
 * @param req - the Node request.
 * @param res - the Node response, used to answer a failure.
 * @param maxBytes - the largest body accepted, in bytes. Optional, and
 * deliberately left `undefined` when the caller does not care: `readJsonBody`
 * owns the 64 KiB cap, and a default here would quietly override it.
 * @returns `{ ok: true, body }`, or `{ ok: false }` once a 400 has been sent.

/**
 * Whether a card request came from this machine, same-origin.
 *
 * The routes expose model metadata, not credentials, but they stay loopback-only
 * anyway: they are an internal read path for a browser page this host itself
 * served, and a missing Origin (a same-origin GET) is the normal case.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG, AND WHY IT WAS NOT JUST COSMETIC
 *
 * The rule used to be "the Origin's host NAME is loopback" — the port was not
 * compared at all, with a comment saying that was a deliberate trade. It was not
 * a trade, it was a hole, and the three POST routes made it expensive:
 *
 *   /save           change which models appear in DSH's picker, and per-model
 *                   image input
 *   /checkin        claim the daily Credits — a real account mutation
 *   /account/reload bring a region online and re-read the credential store
 *
 * Any HTTP server the user visits on their own machine could have its JavaScript
 * call these. A page at `http://127.0.0.1:anything` posting to
 * `http://127.0.0.1:19387/…` sends `Origin: http://127.0.0.1:anything`, which
 * passed a name-only check. The browser would not stop it either: the response
 * is not readable cross-origin, but the SIDE EFFECT has already happened.
 *
 * THE RULE NOW: same-origin, verified against the request's own `Host` header.
 *
 * `Host` is what the client actually dialled, so comparing Origin's authority to
 * it needs no configured port and cannot drift when DSH picks a different one at
 * runtime — which is why this is right where "hardcode the web port" would not
 * be. The host must ALSO be loopback, because a same-origin check alone would
 * trust a DSH served on a real interface, and this plugin's routes are an
 * internal surface whether or not the front end is.
 *
 * @param req - the Node request.
 * @returns true when the request may proceed.
