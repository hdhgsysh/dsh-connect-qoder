 * The settings save pipeline.
 *
 * Extracted from the `__save` route in lib/index.js so it can be tested. The
 * route's whole reason for existing is a defect on the DSH 0.1.7 line: the
 * client-side `settingsScope.set()` can resolve successfully without persisting
 * anything — the host's atomic write exhausts its retries on a locked file, the
 * scope reloads the previous document, and success is reported anyway. The card
 * would then show "已保存" while the model roster, image overrides and context
 * window had all silently failed to change, with nothing to indicate it.
 *
 * So a write here is only a success once the value has been read back out of the
 * document and compared. That check, the per-region merge, and the namespace
 * resolution all lived inline in an HTTP handler where no test could reach them.
 * They are here now as a function of `(settings, body)` — no Cordis, no
 * framework, no request or response objects.
