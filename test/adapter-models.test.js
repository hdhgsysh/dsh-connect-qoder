/**
 * Tests for the model list one region offers DSH.
 *
 * Run: node --test test/adapter-models.test.js
 *
 * This is the model list DSH's picker is built from, and it was previously
 * inside `createQoderAdapter` — which no test can import, because it pulls in
 * pi-ai (docs/KNOWN_GAPS.md item 1（`adapter.ts` 的 Cordis 接线与 profile 构造）).
 * So every curation decision the user makes — the per-region switch, the
 * allow-list, the maximum-context preference, the per-model image mode — was
 * made in code with no test over it, in a file outside the coverage
 * denominator entirely.
 *
 * All four failures are silent, which is why they are worth pinning here rather
 * than assumed:
 *
 * - a region switch that stops switching hides a provider with no error;
 * - a filter that stops filtering offers models the user deliberately unticked;
 * - a context preference that is ignored is invisible until someone notices the
 *   picker disagreeing with the card;
 * - an image mode that is dropped makes every image request fail with
 *   UNSUPPORTED_CONTENT instead of an obviously wrong model list.
