/**
 * Tests for the per-platform application-data root.
 *
 * Run: node --test test/app-data-root.test.js
 *
 * This is the half of cross-platform support that is unambiguously correct and
 * verifiable here, taken separately from the keystore work that is not
 * (docs/KNOWN_GAPS.md item 6（跨平台凭据链未实现（macOS / Linux）)). Reading
 * `process.env.APPDATA` directly is why this plugin has never worked off
 * Windows: the variable does not exist on macOS, so every probe got `''`, found
 * no app directory, and reported "not signed in" for a user who plainly was.
 *
 * The point of doing this first is what it makes true, not what it makes
 * possible. Off Windows the unwrap still cannot run, so a sign-in is still not
 * READABLE — but the app directory is now FOUND, which means the account panel
 * can say "the app is installed here and this build cannot read its key" instead
 * of denying the app exists, and the keystore side lands on a correct path
 * rather than a wrong one.
