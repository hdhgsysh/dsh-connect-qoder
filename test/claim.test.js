/**

 *
 * The fixtures are the real campaigns this account returned on 2026-09-27
 * (ids kept, nothing secret in them): one `CLAIM_BENEFIT` round already claimed,
 * and one `VIEW_DETAILS` subscription promotion. That second one is the whole
 * reason this file exists — it reports `claimStatus: "CLAIMED"` while carrying
 * no benefit at all, so any check-in that selects its campaign by status alone
 * would happily claim nothing and report success.
 *
 * Assertions therefore target the selectors directly, and each one has been
 * chosen so that deleting its guard turns something here red rather than
 * merely changing a number.
