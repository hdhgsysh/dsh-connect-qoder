/**
 * Guard the card's off-peak gate against regressions in the shipped bundle.
 *
 * Run: node --test test/client-bundle.test.js
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * `test/model-row.test.js` carries a hand-written transcription of the card's
 * `offPeakState` rule, and that transcription is correct. It is also useless as
 * a guard: it asserts against itself. Measured, not assumed — deleting the
 * `promo.active !== true` line from `lib/client.js` (the one that stopped the
 * card showing a discount nobody gets) leaves that file fully green, because the
 * copy in the test still has the line.
 *
 * The bundle cannot simply be imported: it is an esbuild output that calls
 * `window.__ModuleLoader__.load` and reaches for `react` and `react/jsx-runtime`
 * at load time. So the two pure functions the gate depends on are extracted from
 * the bundle TEXT and evaluated here. They are the real shipped code, so
 * removing a line from `lib/client.js` turns this file red — which is what makes
 * it a guard rather than a restatement.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL NOT COVERED
 *
 * Everything around the gate: the JSX rendering, the clock interval, the fetch
 * of the host route, the settings write. Those need the browser, or the
 * TypeScript sources this repository does not have (test/KNOWN_GAPS.md item 2).
 * What is covered is the one thing that computes a number the user is shown.
