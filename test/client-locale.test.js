/**
 * Guard the card's copy against the failure that actually shipped in 0.4.3.
 *
 * Run: node --test test/client-locale.test.js
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * In 0.4.3 the client registered its translation table under the literal
 * `"settings.qoder"` — a namespace the HOST has never served. The host's own
 * namespace resolution (`settingsNamespaceOf` in src/host/settings-save.ts)
 * keys off the Loader entry, falling back to `dsh-connect-qoder`; on 0.1.7 it
 * is the provider name `llm-qoder`. None of those is `settings.qoder`.
 *
 * When `locale.bind(ns)` cannot find a table for `ns`, it does not throw — it
 * returns the key it was asked for. So the card rendered `account.reload`,
 * `usage.checkin` and the rest as literal dotted identifiers. Two things made
 * that hard to see:
 *
 *   1. A key-echo looks identical to a MISSING TRANSLATION, in every locale.
 *      The report that arrived was "there is no English translation", which
 *      points at the copy tables — and those were complete and correct all
 *      along. 192 keys, both languages. Nothing was wrong with them.
 *   2. No test touched `locale.register` at all. `grep locale test/` was
 *      empty, so the whole registration path was unguarded.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE PINS
 *
 * The two namespaces must be ONE value. Not "the client's namespace is
 * `dsh-connect-qoder`" — that would just re-hardcode a constant that the host
 * is allowed to change. It asserts the invariant that was violated: whatever
 * namespace the client registers copy under is the same namespace it resolves
 * the settings scope with, and it is derived from what the host serves rather
 * than from a literal.
 *
 * It drives the REAL shipped bundle, not a transcription: the module factory is
 * extracted and evaluated with a stub `ctx` that records what was registered.
 * That is what makes it a guard — reintroducing the literal turns it red.
