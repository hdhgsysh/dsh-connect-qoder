/**
 * Tests for the credential cache — the mechanism behind this plugin's claim
 * that a re-sign-in needs no DSH restart.
 *
 * Run: node --test test/credential-cache.test.js
 *
 * This file exists because the two halves of that behaviour were tested while
 * the connection between them was not. `isStaleCredentialError` and
 * `isCredentialUsable` each had assertions, but the flag that turns a sign-in
 * rejection into a re-read lived inside `RegionRuntime`, which cannot be
 * imported — lib/index.js pulls in the Cordis peer dependencies. Two tested
 * parts and one untested wire is still no test: a change that dropped the
 * `invalidate` call, or set the flag without clearing the cache, would have
 * passed everything else in this directory.
 *
 * The store is a closure over a mutable value, so a test can simulate the user
 * re-signing in the desktop app and then assert the next request picks it up.
 * No real credential files, no network, and no fake timers: `resolve()` is
 * driven explicitly.
 *
 * One line is deliberately not asserted: `this.cached = undefined` in the
 * "no credential found" branch. `isCredentialUsable(undefined)` is already
 * false, so leaving a stale value in that slot produces the same observable
 * behaviour — the next resolve re-reads either way. Removing the line was
 * measured to leave this file green, and the two paths are not distinguishable
 * from outside. See test/KNOWN_GAPS.md.
