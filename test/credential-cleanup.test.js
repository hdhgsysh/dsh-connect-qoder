/**
 * Tests for the credential temp-file cleanup.
 *
 * Run: node --test test/credential-cleanup.test.js
 *
 * The unwrap hands the app's 32-byte master key to JavaScript through a
 * `%TEMP%` file, and that file is the one place in this plugin where a secret
 * exists outside the process. Its removal is a security property, not
 * housekeeping — the README promises the plugin "stores no credentials", and a
 * leftover `key.b64` breaks that promise for every same-user process on the box
 * until something reclaims it.
 *
 * The failure this file guards was a silent one. When the PowerShell child is
 * killed by the unwrap timeout, its exclusive (`FileShare.None`) handle on
 * `key.b64` is closed by the kernel asynchronously — a killed process runs no
 * `finally` — and until that teardown finishes, `zeroOutFile` fails its open
 * and `rmSync` fails too. `zeroOutFile` used to swallow every error, so the key
 * sat in TEMP as plain base64 with no report, and the next reclaim was a plugin
 * start away (the entry sweeps once at activation, not on a timer). The fix is
 * a short retry that waits out the teardown, and a report when the hazard
 * survives anyway. This file asserts both.
 *
 * PLATFORM: the hand-off only exists on Windows (DPAPI), so the locked-file
 * assertions are gated to `win32`; the reclaim and age-guard behaviour is
 * asserted everywhere. The lock is taken by a real PowerShell child, not by a
 * second Node handle — libuv opens files with `FILE_SHARE_READ|WRITE|DELETE`,
 * so a Node-side "lock" blocks nothing and the branch under test never runs.
 * (An earlier revision of this file made exactly that mistake; and an earlier
 * probe compared a file the holder never touched and drew the opposite
 * conclusion. Both are recorded here so neither is re-derived by feel.)
