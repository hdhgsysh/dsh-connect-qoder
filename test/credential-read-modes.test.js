/**
 * Tests for the three credential-reading modes and how they are routed.
 *
 * Run: node --test test/credential-read-modes.test.js
 *
 * There are now three ways to ask for a region's sign-in, and the difference
 * between them is a performance and responsiveness property, not a semantic
 * one — all three must still report the same STATES, or the card's account
 * panel would show different things depending on how the answer was fetched.
 *
 *   default      read the store, unwrapping a key if needed
 *   cachedOnly   read the store WITHOUT unwrapping a key (issue 07)
 *   force        read the store, unwrapping even inside the failure window
 *
 * `cachedOnly` exists because the account route runs on every panel render and
 * an OSCrypt unwrap is a synchronous PowerShell child with a 30 s timeout: a
 * machine that cannot unwrap would block the host's event loop once per render,
 * while the panel that must explain that state is the thing being blocked.
 * `force` is the opposite end, for the one request that IS a user-initiated
 * re-read — without it, pressing "重读登录" inside the failure window would
 * silently do nothing, which is worse than the freeze it fixed.
 *
 * A silent misrouting is the failure mode worth guarding: a wrong flag here
 * produces no error, no wrong-looking output — just a UI that stalls, or a
 * button that does nothing. So the routing is asserted, not just the outcomes.
