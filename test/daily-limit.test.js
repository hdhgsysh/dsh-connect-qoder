/**
 * Tests for the daily billing limit as its own kind of failure.
 *
 * Run: node --test test/daily-limit.test.js
 *
 * WHAT HAPPENED
 *
 * A user sent a request and got:
 *
 *   失败原因：502: {"message":"Qoder upstream error 110: Billing daily count exceeded",
 *              "type":"upstream_error","code":"upstream_error"}
 *   重试延迟：7350毫秒
 *
 * Two things in that are wrong, and they are the same mistake seen twice. The
 * gateway classified a SPENT DAILY ALLOWANCE as a queue — the payload carries
 * the queue markers and a `Retry-After` of 7350 seconds, which is about two
 * hours — and the plugin believed it. So the user was told a request would be
 * retried, for something no amount of retrying can change: the counter resets
 * at the day boundary rather than draining. And the status was `502`, which
 * reads as "Qoder broke" when the truth is "you have used today's requests".
 *
 * WHERE THE BOUNDARY IS DRAWN
 *
 * The classifier checks `110` BEFORE the queue-marker fallback, and the reason
 * is the whole test: this payload HAS the markers. A rule that matched markers
 * first would classify it as a queue no matter what the code said, and the
 * multi-hour hint would be honoured as a retry delay.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASSERTED HERE, AND WHAT IS NOT
 *
 * The envelope is taken from that user report rather than from a live probe:
 * `probe/daily-limit-probe.mjs` could not produce it, because the accounts on
 * this machine still had allowance and a real request came back with content.
 * That is stated in the probe too. So the SHAPE below is a specification, and
 * what these tests pin is the plugin's reaction to it — which is the part that
 * was wrong and the part a future edit could repeat.
