/**
 * Guard the repository's PROSE against the same disease its code tests guard
 * against: statements that outlive the facts they describe.
 *
 * Run: node --test test/docs-facts.test.js
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * The card-source restore (`121d1a3`, docs/issues/17) invalidated a whole
 * generation of statements — "the sources are not in this repository", "the
 * bundle holds the card on its own", "根治仍取决于 src 入库" — and every
 * gate stayed green. The suite can only catch drift in code; nothing caught
 * drift in the prose, while the prose is exactly where this repository keeps
 * its load-bearing claims (sync constraints, cross-references, file roles). A
 * stale comment does what a hand-copied transcription did in
 * model-row.test.js: it asserts a rule nobody still has to follow, confidently.
 *
 * So this file is the prose gate. It enforces one layout rule while it is
 * here: docs/KNOWN_GAPS.md is the single source for gap claims, and a live
 * file may point at a numbered item only with the item's heading quoted in
 * parentheses — a bare number rots the moment the list is edited.
 *
 * All matching runs on WHITESPACE-FLATTENED text: comments wrap, and a rule
 * that only holds on unwrapped lines would be a gate with holes in it.
 * docs/PLAN.md and docs/issues/**, docs/history/** are deliberately NOT under
 * guard: they are dated audit snapshots, kept as filed. A stale claim inside
 * a dated record is a fact about the past, not a lie about the present.
