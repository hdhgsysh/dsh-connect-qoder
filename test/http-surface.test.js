/**
 * Tests for the HTTP surface the card's routes present.
 *
 * Run: node --test test/http-surface.test.js
 *
 * Two things that a browser — or any HTTP client — reads to decide what to do
 * next, and which were both wrong (docs/issues/12, item 4):
 *
 * - **A 405 must carry `Allow`** (RFC 9110 §15.5.6). Without it the response is
 *   malformed: the status says "not this method" and nothing says what would
 *   have been accepted.
 * - **A HEAD on a GET route is a GET without a body**, not a rejection. It was
 *   rejected, which made a correct request fail and removed the cheapest
 *   "is this endpoint there" probe there is.
 *
 * `sendJson` is importable (no peer dependencies), so the writer is tested for
 * real against a response stand-in. The 405 path itself lives in src/host/index.ts,
 * which cannot be imported — that half is pinned textually by
 * test/account-route-wiring.test.js's approach, here in a smaller form.
