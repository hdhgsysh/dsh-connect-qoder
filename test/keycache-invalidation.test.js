/**
 * Tests for the OSCrypt key cache's invalidation rule.
 *
 * Run: node --test test/keycache-invalidation.test.js
 *
 * The bug this file exists for (issue 08) was a permanent, self-inflicted
 * `needs-app`: the cache was keyed by app directory alone, so a Qoder reinstall
 * or profile reset — which rewrites `Local State` with a fresh
 * `os_crypt.encrypted_key` — left the running process decrypting with the OLD
 * key. Every read then failed, nothing in the code could ever retry, and the
 * region stayed "unreadable" until DSH was restarted. There was no upper bound
 * on how long: the lifetime of the process.
 *
 * The rule is tested through `cachedKeyFor` rather than by launching PowerShell,
 * because the DPAPI unwrap needs a live Windows app and would make this file
 * either skip on CI or too slow to run often — which is exactly how the original
 * unbounded cache survived. What is asserted here is the decision the unwrap
 * makes on every call, and the decision is the whole fix.
