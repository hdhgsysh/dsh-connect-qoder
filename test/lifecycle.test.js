/**
 * Tests for what a fiber undoes on dispose.
 *
 * Run: node --test test/lifecycle.test.js
 *
 * Every `webServer.register` call in this plugin used to throw its return value
 * away, and whether that leaks depends on a question a plugin cannot answer
 * from its own checkout: does `@deepseek-ai/dsh-host-webserver` reclaim a
 * registration with its fiber, or does it need an explicit release? The package
 * ships inside the host's `app.asar`, which is not readable here, so the answer
 * is genuinely unknown (docs/issues/13).
 *
 * The fix is not to guess. The registrations are collected and released if — and
 * only if — `register` returned something callable, which is correct under both
 * host behaviours and degrades to today's behaviour if the shape ever changes.
 * What is worth pinning is that the handling is total: a non-function return
 * from one registration must not stop the others being collected, and a release
 * that throws must not strand the ones after it.
 *
 * The cost of being wrong the other way is concrete: a leaked route keeps its
 * handler, and through it a whole runtime, reachable after the plugin is
 * disabled — a POST would then start a shim and a refresh interval that nothing
 * will ever clean up.
