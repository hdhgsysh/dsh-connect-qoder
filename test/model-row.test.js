 * carry the whole `promotion` block, and `catalog-fields.test.js` did assert it
 * — but the host route re-projected that block field by field on its way to the
 * card, and the projection left out `active` and `timezone`.
 *
 * The card gates its ticking clock on `models.some((m) => m.promotion?.active
 * === true)`. With `active` missing that gate is permanently false, so the
 * one-second interval is never installed, `setClock` never fires again, and the
 * 22:00 rate flip and countdown never happen without a manual card refresh. The
 * window and the rate still rendered, so nothing looked broken.
 *
 * The projection now lives in `lib/catalog-entry.js` as a pure function so it
 * can be asserted directly; the test imports it for the same reason the sibling
 * test stopped mirroring: a hand-written copy cannot catch a bug in the code it
 * is a copy of.
