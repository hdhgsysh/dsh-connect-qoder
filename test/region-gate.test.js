/**
 * Tests for the decision to publish a region as a provider.
 *
 * Run: node --test test/region-gate.test.js
 *
 * A region is offered to DSH only when it can actually answer. Publishing one
 * whose sign-in is missing or expired puts a dead route in the model picker:
 * the user selects it, the gateway answers 403, and the UI blames their
 * account for a channel this plugin should never have offered.
 *
 * The decision lived inside `startRegion` (src/host/index.ts), which no test can
 * import. What makes it worth pinning is not the boolean — it is that the
 * THREE refusals are different, carry different log levels, and each points at
 * a different user action:
 *
 * - no sign-in at all is the normal state of a fresh install (info, "sign in");
 * - an expired token needs the app opened to renew (warn, with that instruction);
 * - an unreadable one is a DPAPI/unwrap failure the user must investigate
 *   (warn, plus the error object).
 *
 * Collapsing them into one boolean is the tempting simplification, and it would
 * leave an operator with a log that says "not registered" and nothing about
 * which of the three happened.
