/**
 * Tests for the unwrap-failure window that caps how often a broken machine
 * pays for a blocking subprocess (issue 07).
 *
 * Run: node --test test/unwrap-failure-window.test.js
 *
 * The unwrap is `execFileSync` with a 30 s timeout, reached from the card's
 * account route on every render. The original rule — "a failure is never
 * cached" — was chosen so a transient fault could not pin a region as unusable
 * for the life of the process, and it is right about that. It was wrong about
 * the cost: an app whose `Local State` cannot be unwrapped is precisely the
 * state the account panel exists to explain, so opening the panel, switching
 * tabs and re-opening it each paid a synchronous subprocess, blocking the whole
 * host event loop for up to 30 s per render.
 *
 * So the failure is remembered for a short window. The two properties that make
 * that safe are asserted here, and both are the ones a future edit is most
 * likely to break:
 *
 * - the window EXPIRES, so a user who fixed the machine and retried is not told
 *   "unreadable" for a minute;
 * - a rewritten `Local State` ends the window EARLY, so the retry lands when the
 *   user re-signed-in rather than up to a minute later — the same
 *   "bind the answer to the file it came from" rule the key cache uses.
 *
 * And the one that is NOT a property: the recorded reason stays readable inside
 * the window. Suppressing the retry must not blank the explanation.
